This project focuses on employing a Double Deep Q Learning agent in stock analysis using candle stick patterns as input of the IA.

This project is inspired by the Research Paper "Deep reinforcement learning stock market trading, utilizing a CNN with candlestick images: Deep reinforcement learning stock market trading, utilizing a CNN with candlestick images", by Andrew Brim and Nicholas S. Flann, University of Utah. (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263181)

The first version of the project is built using a single Deep learning CNN. The code can be found in the folder "Alpha" and run by executing the third cell. The IA proceeds to run a fixed number of random trials (defined by the batch size) in order to create a learning basis and further proceeds to learn from the batch using the CNN.

The candle stick images for this programme have been generated using the code from the folder "CandleManipulation" from file "Candle sticks.ipynb" by executing the all the cells.
